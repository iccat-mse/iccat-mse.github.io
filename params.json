Basing an operating model on the current assessment model has arguably the lowest demands for knowledge and data. Although use of the assessment model as the operating model seems to imply that assessment models describe nature almost perfectly, if an MP cannot perform well when reality is as simple as implied by an assessment model, it is unlikely to perform adequately for more realistic representations of uncertainty. \r\n\r\nTherefore in the development of MSE within ICCAT the 1st stage is to take the existing assessments as the OMs\r\n\r\n# Applications\r\n\r\n##  North Atlantic Albacore \r\n\r\nICCAT has asked the SCRS to evaluate a Harvest Control Rule (HCR) for North Atlantic albacore using Management Strategy Evaluation, see http://iccat-mse.github.io/albn-mse.html for a summary. \r\n\r\nWork started on the [MSE](http://iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV070_2014/n_5/CV070052096.pdf) in 2013 when advice was provided in the form of a [HCR](http://iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV070_2014/n_3/CV070031355.pdf) with target and limit reference points. This HCR was then simulation tested using an Operating Model (OM) based on [Multifan-CL](http://iccat.int/Documents/CVSP/CV070_2014/n_3/CV070030717.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe code used to conduct the MSE is available from a public [github repository](https://github.com/iccat-mse/albn), and uses the [FLR](http://www.flr-project.org/) libraries written in R.\r\n\r\nThe stock is to be [reassessed](http://iccat.int/Documents/0992-16_ENG.PDF) in 2016 and in light of this new assessment the Commission shall review the results of the MSE conducted so far and make adjustments to the HCRs as required [(Rec-015-04)](http://iccat.int/Documents%5CRecs%5Ccompendiopdf-e%5C2015-04-e.pdf).\r\n\r\nAn Operating Model has been developed based on [Multifan-CL](http://iccat-mse.github.io/albn-om.html), there is already an implicit Management Procedure (MP) based on a biomass dynamic model and a hockey stick Harvest Control Rule. and the OM has been used to simulate test the [MP](http://iccat-mse.github.io/albn-sa.html) \r\n\r\n## Mediterranean Albacore \r\n\r\n## Mediterranean Swordfish \r\n\r\n## Mediterannean Bluefin ",
