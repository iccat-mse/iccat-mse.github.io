{"name":"ICCAT MSE","tagline":"Operating Models and Implicit Management Procedures based on ICCAT stock assessments","body":"ICCAT MSE\r\n\r\nThis site hosts work on some of the MSE using R being conducted by the SCRS\r\n\r\n# MSE involves a number of steps\r\n\r\n* Identification of management objectives and mapping these into utility functions or statistical indicators of performance;\r\n* Selection of hypotheses for the operating models (OMs) that serve as the simulated version of reality;\r\n* Conditioning of the OMs using data and knowledge, and weighting of possible model hypotheses\b depending on their plausibility;\r\n* Identifying candidate management strategies and coding these as MPs;\r\n* Projecting the OMs forward in time using the MPs as a feedback controller, simulating the impact of management \\citep{ramaprasad1983definition}; and\r\n* identifying the elements of MPs that best meet management objectives.\r\n\r\n## Operating Models\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of developing OMs and the amount of knowledge, data requirements and complexity differs quite markedly depending on the type to be used. Basing an operating model on the current assessment model has arguably the lowest demands for knowledge and data. Although use of the assessment model as the operating model seems to imply that assessment models describe nature almost perfectly, if an MP cannot perform well when reality is as simple as implied by an assessment model, it is unlikely to perform adequately for more realistic representations of uncertainty. \r\n\r\nTherefore in the development of MSE within ICCAT the 1st stage is to take the existing assessments as the OMs\r\n\r\n# Applications\r\n\r\n##  North Atlantic Albacore \r\n An Operating Model has been developed based on Multifan-CL http://iccat-mse.github.io/albn-om.html\r\n There is already an implicit Management Procedure (MP) based on a biomass dynamic model and a hockey stick Harvest Control Rule which will be simulation tested using MSE \r\n\r\n## Mediterranean Albacore \r\n\r\n## Mediterranean Swordfish \r\n\r\n## Mediterannean Bluefin \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
